# Singly Linked List Practice

- Implement your solutions in the files in the exercises directory. I recommend doing them in the same order as they are listed in list.h - the later exercises can be quite difficult.
- To test out your solution, run the command `./build.sh <function name>` where `function name` is the name of the function you implemented. For example, `./build.sh listDeleteLargest`. If your code compiles successfully, an executable called `testList` will be created. Then, run the command `./testList` to test your implementation.
- I have not released the solutions yet, to eliminate the temptation to look at them. If you're not sure how to start on a particular function, try drawing some examples first.
