# Singly Linked List Practice

- Implement your solutions in the files in the exercises directory. I recommend doing them in the same order as they are listed in list.h - the later exercises can be quite difficult.
- To test out your implementation, run the command `./build.sh <exercise>` where `exercise` is the name of the exercise. For example, `./build.sh listDeleteLargest`. If your code compiles successfully, an executable called `testList` will be created. Then, run the command `./testList` to test your implementation.
- To test out the solution for an exercise, run the command `./build.sh -s <exercise>` (`-s` tells the script to compile the solution rather than your implementation). Then, run the command `./testList`.
- If you are working on Windows you may have to replace list.h in the exercises, solutions, and testDrivers directories with the list.h in this directory (singlyLinkedLists).
