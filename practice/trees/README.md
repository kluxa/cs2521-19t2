# Trees Practice Questions

- Implement your solutions in the files in the exercises directory.
- To test your code manually, first compile your code with the command `./compile <exercise>` where `exercise` is the name of the exercise. For example, `./compile treeSumEvens`. If your code compiles successfully, an executable called `testTree` will be created. Then, run `./testTree` to test your program.
- To run the autotest on any number of exercises, use the command `./autotest <exercise 1> <exercise 2> ...`. To autotest all exercises, use the `-a` option.
- To test out the solution for an exercise, first compile it with `./compile -s <exercise>` (`-s` tells the script to compile the solution rather than your implementation). Then, run `./testList`. Let me know if you find any bugs in the solutions!
- Have fun!
