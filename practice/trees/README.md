# Trees Practice

- Implement your solutions in the files in the exercises directory.
- To test your code manually, run the command `./compile <exercise>` where `exercise` is the name of the exercise. For example, `./compile treeSumEvens`. If your code compiles successfully, an executable called `testTree` will be created. Then, run the command `./testTree` to test your program.
- To run the autotest on any number of exercises, use the command `./autotest <exercise 1> <exercise 2> ...`. To autotest all exercises, use the `-a` option.
- Have fun!
