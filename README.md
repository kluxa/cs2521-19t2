## Midterm Exam

### Preparation Tips
- Make sure you understand the different cases for insertion and deletion in a doubly linked list
  - Insertion (at the end)
    - Empty
    - Non-empty

  - Deletion
    - Already empty
    - Only one node
    - First node
    - Last node
    - Middle node

- Make sure you know how to solve linked list questions using diagrams (it can save your life)

- Get some practice with linked list prac questions
  - Sample midterm
  - Week 1 and 2 lab exercises
  - Linked list practice questions available
    - But, these are singly linked list questions, make sure you also get familiar with doubly linked lists
	- Solutions available (but no autotests)
	- Download the unzip the zip file in the `practice/singlyLinkedLists/` directory

- Get familiar with basic tree operations such as search and insertion
- Get some practice with tree questions, especially using recursion
  - Lecture examples (search and insertion)
  - Sample midterm
  - Week 3 and 4 lab/tutorial exercises
  - Tree practice questions available
    - Autotests and solutions included
	- Download and unzip the zip file in the `practice/trees/` directory
    - Most of them are harder than what you'll get in the midterm

### Exam Tips
- Make sure you understand the data structure
  - Is it a doubly linked list?
  - Does it have a last pointer? Or only a first pointer? Do you need to update these?
  - Does it have a size/nitems field? Do you need to update this?
- List out the different cases
- If you're not 100% confident, draw a diagram and walk through your code using that diagram
- Test your code yourself - the autotest might not cover all of the cases
