## Midterm Exam

### Preparation Tips
- Make sure you understand the different cases for insertion and deletion in a doubly linked list
  - Insertion (at the end)

  - Deletion

- Make sure you know how to solve linked list questions using diagrams (it will change your life)

- Get some practice with linked list prac questions
  - Sample midterm
  - Week 1 and 2 lab exercises
  - Linked list practice questions available
    - But, these are singly linked list questions, make sure you also get familiar with doubly linked lists
	- Solutions available (but no autotests)
	- Download the unzip the zip file in the `practice/singlyLinkedLists/` directory

- Get some practice with tree prac questions, especially using recursion
  - Sample midterm
  - Week 3 and 4 lab/tutorial exercises
  - Tree practice questions available
    - Autotests and solutions included
	- Download and unzip the zip file in the `practice/trees/` directory

### Exam Tips
- Make sure you understand the data structure
  - Is it a doubly linked list?
  - Does it have a last pointer? Or only a first pointer? Do you need to update these?
  - Does it have a size/nitems field? Do you need to update this?
- List out the different cases
- If you're not 100% confident, draw a diagram and walk through your code using that diagram
